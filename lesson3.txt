When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with other people.  Also, if working on a project from multiple
and/or remote computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might be working on my local repo (say, fixing a bug), and I don't want to pull any
changes from the remote until I'm done.
