When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with other people.  Also, if working on a project from multiple
and/or remote computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might be working on my local repo (say, fixing a bug), and I don't want to pull any
changes from the remote until I'm done. When fixing a bug, it is best not to 
add any more changes until the bug is fixed.  Otherwise, it becomes harder to
track down the source of the bug.


fork - copy of a GitHub repo.  both original and copy reside on GitHub.

clone - copy of another repo (could be a fork) that resides on your local 
computer


branch - label for a commit.

use fork to make a copy of a repo on GitHub.

use clone to make a local copy of a repo.

use branch to track a series of related changes to the project.


Having a local copy of the remote allows me to work with the remote even
when I don't have internet access.

Without github collaborators could share files using other means like emailing
tarballs to each other or using dropbox.  this makes it a lot harder to make
sure everyone is working on the same file versions.  on the other hand, if the
project is private, no money has to be spent on getting a private github repo.


making changes in a separate branch offers the opportunity to check changes
and make sure everything is OK before merging into the master.  If we are 
sure the changes are good, then it is simpler and faster to make a change 
directly on the master.
