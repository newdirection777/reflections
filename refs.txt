L1

git log shows the commit ids and commit messages for previous commits.
by reading the commit messages, one gets an idea of the evolution of the project.
by doing a git diff, one can see the specific changes made in a particular commit.

using vers. contr.  makes me more confident to make changes, knowing that
if things go bad, I can revert to a previous version that works.


I'll use git when developing my programs, games, apps, and udacity projects.
